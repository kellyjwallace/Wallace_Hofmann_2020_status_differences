# Wallace_Hofmann_2020_status_differences

This repository contains the R analysis code and csv data files associated with the publication by Wallace & Hofmann on status differences in cognition in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. 

Please note that running the entire R code at once (e.g. select all and run) will yield different results than those seen the publication, therefore please run the first series of chunks (loading the packages and acquiring the dataframes) then jump to the chunk of interest.

For access to the individual csv files (Cowlog score sheets) for each video, please email kelly.wallace@emory.edu

Thank you!
