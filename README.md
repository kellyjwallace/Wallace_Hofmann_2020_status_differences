# Wallace_Hofmann_2020_status_differences

This repository contains the R analysis code and csv data files associated with the publication Wallace & Hofmann "Social ascent affects cognition, behavior, and physiology in a highly social cichlid fish" 

Please note that running the entire R code at once may yield different results than the publication, therefore it is best to first run the first series of chunks (acquiring the dataframes) then jump to the chunk of interest.

For access to the individual csv files (cowlog score sheets) for each video, please email kwallace@utexas.edu

Thank you!
